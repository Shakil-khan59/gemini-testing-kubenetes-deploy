Instrucion for both Ingress and KONG Gateway


Since Minikube doesn't provide a real DNS, you need to map the hostname (gemini-app.local) 
to the Minikube IP address. 

Update Your /etc/hosts File
  - minikube ssh
  - cd etc/
  - vim hosts
    - write <ip> gemini-app.local 


You can now access your application at http://gemini-app.local
